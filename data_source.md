# NHS Outcomes Framework - Indicator 2.2: Employment of People with Long-Term Conditions

## Overview

This document provides details about Indicator 2.2 of the NHS Outcomes Framework, which focuses on the employment of people with long-term health conditions in England. The indicator measures the difference in employment rates between the general working-age population and people of working age who report having a long-term condition.

## Key Objectives

*   To improve employment rates for people with long-term health conditions.
*   To monitor and reduce the employment gap between this population and the general population in England.

## Data Source

*   **Primary Source:** Labour Force Survey (LFS) data, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
*   **Release Frequency:** Quarterly data released approximately three months after the end of the relevant quarter.
*   **Link to Data:** [ONS Labour Market Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/previousReleases)

## Indicator Calculation

1.  **Employment Rate (General Population):**
    *   **Denominator:** Total number of people of working age (16-64) in England.
    *   **Numerator:** Number of working-age people in employment (including employees, self-employed, participants in government employment programs, and unpaid family workers).

2.  **Employment Rate (People with Long-Term Conditions):**
    *   **Denominator:** Total number of working-age people who report having a long-term health condition (expected to last more than a year).
    *   **Numerator:** Number of working-age people with long-term conditions who are in employment.

3.  **Indicator Value:** The difference between the employment rate of the general population and the employment rate of people with long-term conditions (expressed as a percentage point difference).

## Data Filters

*   Data is filtered to include only respondents residing in England.

## LFS Variables Used

*   **MF1664:** Indicates working age (16-64).
*   **INECAC05:** Indicates employment status (employee, self-employed, etc.).
*   **LNGLST:** Indicates if a respondent has a health problem or disability that is expected to last more than a year (used from 2013 Q2 onwards).
    *   **Note:** Prior to 2013 Q2, **LNGLIM** was used instead of LNGLST.

## Data Weighting

*   The Labour Force Survey (LFS) data is weighted using person-level weights. The specific weight variable changes over time as follows:
    *   Q1 2006 - Q4 2010: PWT10
    *   Q1 2011 - Q2 2014: PWT11
    *   Q3 2014 - Q4 2015: PWT14
    *   Q1 2016 - Q4 2016: PWT16
    *   Q1 2017 - Present: PWT17

## Data Breakdowns

The data is disaggregated by the following variables:

*   **Gender (SEX)**
*   **Age (AGE)** (banded)
*   **Ethnicity (ETH01 to end 2010, then ETH11EW)**
*   **Region (GOVTOF)**
*   **Unitary Authority/Local Area (UALA)**
*   **NS-SEC Category (NSECM10)**
*   **Religion (RELIG to end 2010, then RELIGE)**

## Time Period

*   Quarterly data is available from 2006 onwards.

## Presentation

*   Data is presented at the England level and for various breakdowns:
    *   Demographic: Gender, age bands, ethnicity, NS-SEC category, and religion.
    *   Geographic: England, regions, and unitary authority/local area levels.

## Disclosure Control

*   Statistical disclosure control is applied to the LFS data by ONS. Data is suppressed where sample sizes are small to protect individual privacy. Any estimates based on a sample size of 1 or 2 are suppressed and secondary suppression is carried out.

## Output Columns

The output data includes the following columns:

*   Year, Quarter, Period of Coverage
*   Person Level Weight used
*   Breakdown (e.g. England, Gender, Age)
*   Level (a further description of breakdown)
*   Employment rate of people with long-term conditions (percentage)
*   Employment rate of population (percentage)
*   Indicator value (percentage point difference)
*   Long-term condition numerator (number of people)
*   Long-term condition denominator (number of people)
*   Population numerator (number of people)
*   Population denominator (number of people)

## Notes and Definitions

*   Users should be aware that estimates based on sample sizes below 10,000 are subject to a high degree of sampling variability.
*  Data is rounded.
*  The indicator values are calculated using unrounded employment rates.
*  Data is suppressed due to small numbers (marked with *).
*  There are notes about errors associated with "Not classified or inadequately stated" in the NS-SEC variable, which have been removed for Quarters 1 and 3 of 2011.
*   A "Don't know/Refused" category has been added to the Ethnicity and Religion breakdowns from Quarter 3 of 2014.
