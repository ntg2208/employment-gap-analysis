# NHS Chronic Employment Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of employment rates and gaps between the general population and people with long-term conditions in England, using ONS Labour Force Survey data (2006-2018). The dataset is sourced from the NHS Outcomes Framework Indicator 2.2, which measures the difference in employment rates between the general working-age population and those reporting long-term health conditions.

## Analysis Results

### Overall Employment Trends
- Total population showed steady growth from 2006 to 2018
- Long-term condition numbers remained relatively stable at 25-30% of population
- Persistent employment gap exists between general population and those with long-term conditions
- Slight narrowing of gap in recent years indicates improving workplace inclusivity

### Key Demographic Findings

#### Gender
- Women with long-term conditions face larger employment gaps
- Men show consistently higher employment rates across both groups
- Recent years show slight improvement in reducing gaps for both genders

#### Ethnicity
- Chinese workers show unique negative gap (-2.53%), suggesting higher employment rates for those with long-term conditions
- White and Other ethnic groups show similar gaps (~13.7%)
- Black/African/Caribbean groups show lower gaps (~9.8%)

#### Regional Variations
- Merseyside shows highest average gap (16.77%)
- South East shows lowest gap (10.84%)
- London's gap (13.97%) above national average despite economic strength
- Clear north-south divide in employment outcomes

#### Religion
- Jewish communities show lowest average gap (7.31%)
- Christian and Muslim communities show similar gaps (~13%)
- High variability in employment gaps for Buddhist and Sikh communities

### Technical Sector Analysis
- Clear correlation between role complexity and employment accessibility
- Higher professional roles show smaller gaps (5.16-6.36%)
- Semi-routine technical roles show larger gaps (14.00%)
- Employment rates for those with long-term conditions vary significantly:
  * Higher professional: 87.36% employment rate
  * Semi-routine technical: 71.08% employment rate

### Key Implications
1. Despite overall employment growth, significant barriers remain for people with long-term conditions
2. Demographic factors significantly influence employment outcomes
3. Technical sector shows clear stratification in employment accessibility
4. Regional disparities suggest need for targeted interventions
5. Professional and higher-skilled roles show better integration of workers with long-term conditions
